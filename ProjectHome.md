Open Helbreath

Since Outpost (unadvised.net) is DEAD, and most of private servers are dead except some veterans. I was bored and decided to make whole remake of Helbreath.

What is Helbreath?
For those who does not know please visit:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helbreath

Aim of this project is to remake whole game using only GFX, maps and sounds from original Client. Everything has to be rewritten. One of the goals is to rewrite whole Client on SDL. Server files will be rewritten from scratch and will be based on Arye's MySQL server files and written in Python. Login server is half done as I am writing this. HG server is planned to be mixed HBX HG 3.2 with Arye's HG.

Yes, Python. But don't worry, client will be C++.

Whole project aims to be CROSS PLATFORM. This means no problems in porting game to other devices such as PSP, OpenPandora, Symbian etc.

Take a look at Wiki and Download section to Download files.

I WANT TO THANK FOR THE HBX COMMUNITY FOR CONTRIBUTING ALL FILES AND FIXING THEM!
- binarydata and charlie for hosting great message board for helbreath resources
- Hypnotoad, KLKS for constantly writing new HBX server files.
- diuuude and Snoopy81 for doing really great job coding 2.2 original Client source to match original 3.82 client. Again, THANK YOU GUYS.
- Some people that releases (or either leaked) the original source files.
- ... and Siementech for wasting our time on this highly addictive game.
